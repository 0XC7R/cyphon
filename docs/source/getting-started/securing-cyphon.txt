Cyphon environment file
=======================

The `Cyphondock`_ ``cyphon.env`` file contains default usernames and passwords for:

  - Cyphon
  - PostgreSQL
  - RabbitMQ

Please change these values to secure your instance.

Cyphon configuration file
=========================

The Cyphon ``conf.py`` settings file contains default usernames and passwords for:

  - PostgreSQL
  - RabbitMQ

If you're not setting these values through environment variables in the `Cyphondock`_ ``cyphon.env`` file, you should change the default values in ``conf.py``.

You should also change the Django ``SECRET_KEY`` to something unique. See the instructions on :ref:`configuring Django<django-config>` for details.

Cyphon models
=============

The following apps store sensitive data:

 - :ref:`AppUsers<appusers>`
 - `Django Mailbox`_
 - :ref:`Passports<passports>`

Access to their data should be protected by setting proper permissions for users and groups. See :ref:`provisioning-users` for more details.

RSA keys
========

The ``KEYS_DIR`` setting in the Cyphon ``conf.py`` settings file specifies the directory in which Django stores RSA keys associated with :ref:`Passports<passports>`. Public access to this directory should be denied. Check your ``nginx.conf`` file to confirm this.
