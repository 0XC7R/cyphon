Cyphon's backend is based on the `Django`_ web framework. Settings for the
Cyphon Django project are found in the ``cyphon/settings`` directory.

The ``conf.py`` file contains settings specific to your Cyphon instance, including credentials for connecting to PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, and MongoDB.

Edit the ``conf.py`` file with the IP address and/or domain name for your host machine::

    HOST_SETTINGS = {
       'ALLOWED_HOSTS': ['example.com', '127.0.0.1'],
    }

You should also change the Django ``SECRET_KEY`` to something unique.
You can generate one `here <http://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/>`__.

Configure settings for PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch and/or MongoDB. (If you're deploying with `Cyphondock`_, you can use the default settings.)

The ``base.py``, ``dev.py``, and ``prod.py`` files contain more general
settings for Django and other third-party apps used by Cyphon. At a
minimum, you should configure the ``BASE_URL`` setting in the ``dev.py``
and ``prod.py`` files. You can read more about Django's settings in
`Django's documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/settings/>`__.

.. _secrets_management:

Managing Secrets
----------------

In a development environment, hardcoding secrets such as the ``SECRET_KEY`` and
database credentials in the configuration files is typical and usually poses no
security risk, but in a production environment, it is generally a best practice
to use a secrets management tool, such as `Vault <https://www.vaultproject.io/>`__,
or at the very least, encrypt and store secrets separately and inject them into
the server at runtime.

If you are rolling your own secrets management, a reasonable way to configure
Cyphon would be to use ``os.getenv`` for sensitive settings, and pass them into
the Docker container as environment variables.

If you are deploying Cyphon on Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can leverage
the Simple Systems Manager (SSM)
`Parameter Store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html>`__
for secrets management, and use :func:`utils.settings.get_param`.

First, import the following additional packages in your ``cyphon/settings/conf.py`` file::

    # third party
    from ec2_metadata import ec2_metadata

    # local
    from utils.settings import get_param, ON_EC2

Then, below ``HOST_SETTINGS``, add the following code::

    if ON_EC2:
        HOST_SETTINGS['ALLOWED_HOSTS'].append(ec2_metadata.private_ipv4)

Finally, use :func:`~utils.settings.get_param` to import individual settings::

    ELASTICSEARCH = {
        'HOSTS': [
            {
                'host': get_param('elasticsearch_host', 'elasticsearch'),
                'port': int(get_param('elasticsearch_port', '9200')),
                'http_auth': get_param('elasticsearch_http_auth'),
                'use_ssl': bool(int(get_param('elasticsearch_use_ssl', False))),
            },
        ],
    }

The :func:`~utils.settings.get_param` function will first check SSM for
existing parameters, and fall back to environment variables. Defaults can also
be provided, and will be used if no SSM parameters or environment variables
exist. Note that parameters in SSM are expected to be prefixed by namespace,
which is usually a good idea as you can restrict resource access in your
security groups to only specific parameter namespaces. For instance, the
parameters above would be stored in SSM as ``cyphon.elasticsearch_*``.
Of course, the prefix can be changed or disabled if desired.

To store secrets as parameters in SSM, please see the AWS documentation on the
parameter store. Typically, you would use the AWS console or CLI, and ensure
that the parameter type is always set to ``SecureString``, which results in
your secrets being encrypted with your KMS master key.

.. _cyclops-config:

Cyclops
*******

Cyclops is an optional frontend that helps to manage alerts and data from
Cyphon in real time. This product is under a different license than Cyphon,
found `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dunbarcyber/cyclops/master/LICENSE.txt>`__.
Take a quick look over it to make sure your use case doesn't violate the license.

Cyclops is configured with the ``conf.py`` file in the Cyphon settings::

    CYCLOPS = {
        'ENABLED': True,
        'MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN': '',
        'DEVELOPMENT_ENABLED': False,
        'DEVELOPMENT_URL': 'http://localhost:8080/',
    }

In order to show maps with locations and get geolocation data, you can
sign up for a mapbox access token `here <https://www.mapbox.com/studio/signup/>`__
and place it as ``MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN``.

The development configurations are for using different versions of Cyclops
static assets that are hosted on a different server. We use this internally to
test release candidates on our development server before marking them as
publicly available.

The next optional step would be to set up push notifications for Cyclops,
which is explained in :ref:`push-notifications`.
