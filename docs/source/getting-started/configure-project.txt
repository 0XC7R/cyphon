Cyphon's backend is based on the `Django`_ web framework. Settings for the 
Cyphon Django project are found in the ``cyphon/settings`` directory.

The ``conf.py`` file contains settings specific to your Cyphon instance. 
Using your favorite text editor, edit the ``conf.py`` file with the IP 
address and/or domain name for your host machine::

    HOST_SETTINGS = {
       'ALLOWED_HOSTS': ['example.com', '127.0.0.1'],
       'CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST': ['example.com', '127.0.0.1'],
    }

You should also change the Django ``SECRET_KEY`` to something unique. 
You can generate one `here <http://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/>`__.

The ``base.py``, ``dev.py``, and ``prod.py`` files contain more general 
settings for Django and other third` party apps used by Cyphon. At a 
minimum, you should configure the ``BASE_URL`` setting in the ``dev.py`` 
and ``prod.py`` files. You can read more about Django's settings in  
`Django's documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/settings/>`__.

Cyclops

Cyclops is an optional frontend that helps to manage alerts and data from
Cyphon in real time. This product is under a different license than Cyphon,
found `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dunbarcyber/cyclops/master/LICENSE.txt>`__.
Make sure to take a quick look over it before using Cyclops in your use case.

Cyclops is configured with the ``conf.py`` file in the Cyphon settings::

    CYCLOPS = {
        'ENABLED': True,
        'VERSION': '0.4.0',
        'CDN_FORMAT': 'https://cdn.rawgit.com/dunbarcyber/cyclops/{0}/dist/cyclops.{1}',
        'MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN': '',
        'LOCAL_ASSETS_ENABLED': False,
        'LOCAL_ASSETS_PATH': os.path.abspath(os.path.join(PROJ_DIR, '../../cyclops/build')),
        'LOCAL_FOLDER_NAME': 'cyclops',
        'LOCAL_CSS_FILENAME': 'cyclops.css',
        'LOCAL_JS_FILENAME': 'cyclops.js',
    }

The only thing to change in these settings is ``MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN``.
This is required to show maps with locations and to get geolocation data.
You can sign up for an access token
`here <https://www.mapbox.com/studio/signup/>`__.

The next optional step would be to set up push notifications for Cyclops,
which is explained in :ref:`push-notifications`.
